## How do I format and reference my figures?

See Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot).

```{r cars-plot, fig.cap="This is your caption"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

Note: 

* `cars-plot` is the label of your chunk and of the figure produced by the chunk. You reference it from anywhere in the text with `\@ref(fig:cars-plot)` (of course you can/must replace `cars-plot` with something else)

* `fig.cap="This is your caption"` defines your caption. Always caption your figures and tables.
